# EcoMolT5: Ecological-Prompted Multimodal Molecular T5

**EcoMolT5** is an instruction-driven, structure-enhanced multimodal molecular prediction framework that integrates **molecular graphs**, **fingerprints**, and **natural-language task instructions**.  
The model introduces a **fingerprint-guided contrastive learning module** and a **Weak Ecological Prompt (WEP)** mechanism to enhance structureâ€“semantic alignment and improve interpretability in environmental molecular property prediction.

This repository is an **independent extension** based on the open-source [**GIMLET**](https://github.com/zhao-ht/GIMLET) framework (MIT License).  
The original GIMLET model provides an instruction-based moleculeâ€“language foundation architecture for property prediction.  
EcoMolT5 expands upon this foundation by introducing the following key innovations:

1. **Fingerprint-Guided Contrastive Learning**  
   Aligns graph representations with global molecular semantics for improved discriminability.

2. **Integration of the QM9 Dataset**  
   Incorporates quantum-mechanical properties (HOMO/LUMO) to enhance multi-scale physical and biochemical understanding.

3. **Weak Ecological Prompt (WEP)**  
   Embeds ecotoxicological semantics through soft linguistic cues (e.g., *may cause bioaccumulation*) to improve interpretability and zero/few-shot transfer.

4. **Structure-Aware Attention Bias**  
   Injects topological and bond-type priors into Transformer fusion layers for fine-grained structural modeling.
