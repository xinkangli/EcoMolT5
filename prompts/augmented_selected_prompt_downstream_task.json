Nrf2 controls the production of over 250 antioxidant and detoxification proteins, thereby protecting tissues by increasing cellular antioxidant content and suppressing inflammatory signaling pathways.

        "The assay used a biosensor called the cyclic nucleotide gated ion channel to detect cAMP induction, which causes the channel to open and membrane depolarization to occur. A fluorescent dye was used to detect cAMP stimulation in cells. The cells were kept in a specific medium and the assay was used as a counterscreen to control for compounds signaling through other targets of HEK 293 cells. Is the molecule effective to this assay?"

        "The assay detects ERK phosphorylation, which is involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus and plays a key role in cell division and survival. The assay uses AlphaScreen technology and specific antibodies to detect phosphorylated ERK, and it is suitable for high throughput screening. The assay can be used in basic research and drug discovery, especially for cancer chemotherapy. A counter-screen is used to exclude false positives. Is the molecule effective to this assay?"
