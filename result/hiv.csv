Due to the missing 3’hydroxyl group, NRTIs prevent the formation of a 3’-5’-phosphodiester bond in growing DNA chains. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor interacts with the carboxyl group of the protease active site residues, Asp 25 and Asp 25′, by hydrogen bonds. The inhibitor-contacting residues of HIV protease are relatively conserved, including Gly 27, Asp 29, Asp 30, and Gly 48. Is this molecule effective to this assay?",train
