3,muv,ckpts/gimlet_fp3modalnew/checkpoint-10000,0,0,0.6207729468599034,"EphA4 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is part of a large family of receptors called Eph. The signaling ability of EphA4, along with other EphA receptors, is activated by binding to GPI-linked ephrin-A ligands, and it also binds to transmembrane ephrin-B ligands, which are the ligands for another class of Eph receptors called the EphB receptors. Signals are generated both through the Eph receptor kinase domain and through signaling molecules associated with the ephrins. EphA4 plays an important role in inhibiting axon regeneration after spinal cord injury, and inhibiting its function shows promise for therapeutic applications in spinal cord injury, platelet aggregation during thrombus formation, prostate cancer cell growth, and other regions of the central nervous system.

Several natural products that inhibit Hsp90 have anti-tumor effects. However, it has been unclear whether Hsp90 inhibitors can be used as therapeutic agents due to its role in normal cellular homeostasis. Clinical results with the first Hsp90 inhibitor, 17AAG, show promising results in cancer therapy. There is increasing interest in developing novel inhibitors of Hsp90 for use in other diseases.
