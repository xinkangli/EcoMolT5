Additionally, many different malignant cells have been shown to overexpress S1P2. For example, S1P2 is expressed in melanoma cells and is co-expressed together with S1P3 in breast cancer cells. Moreover, S1P2 expression has also been found in glioma cells and nine gastric cancer cell lines were shown to express S1P2 to varying degrees. Finally, the S1P2 selective antagonist JTE-013 has been shown to negatively regulate endothelial morphogenesis and angiogenesis. Is this molecule inhibitor of S1P2?",train,,,

FXIIa is also capable of autoactivation by binding to negatively charged surfaces (1). Kallikrein can also cleave other scissile bonds in FXIIa alpha outside of the catalytic domain at R334, R343, and R353, generating FXIIa beta, a 30 kDa enzyme that is no longer able to bind to surfaces, and which activates prekallikrein (PK) to kallikrein, using high molecular weight kininogen (HK) as a cofactor (2, 3).
