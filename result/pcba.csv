0,pcba,ckpts/gimlet_fp3modalnew/checkpoint-10000,0,0,0.5816260864507656,The assay tests the inhibition of ALDH1A1 activity using propionaldehyde as an electron donor and NAD+ as an electron acceptor. The conversion of NAD+ to NADH is measured via an increase in fluorescence intensity to determine enzyme activity. ALDH1A1 plays critical roles in the metabolic activation of retinoic acid and may be a target for inhibitor development in metabolic diseases. Is the molecule effective to this assay?,train

The assay uses the AlphaScreen platform, which involves proximity-dependent chemical energy transfer luminescence. A counter-screen is used to exclude false positives. The assay is used for both basic research and drug discovery. Is the molecule effective to this assay?",train
4,pcba,ckpts/gimlet_fp3modalnew/checkpoint-10000,0,0,0.6232008490223051,"The assay is a cell-based technique that uses time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) to measure cytosolic IP1 levels in cell lysates. The goal is to identify new cell-permeable inhibitors of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of inositol-1-phosphate (IP1) and plays a role in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol. Lithium is used in small amounts to potentiate the response of weak activators. The successful development of a cell-permeable IMPase inhibitor could lead to an alternative therapy for bipolar disorder with reduced side effects compared to lithium.

The assay uses a luciferase reporter gene appended after the SMN2 gene to measure the amount of functional SMN2 produced. The assay targets increasing the inclusion of exon 7, which generates functional luciferase enzyme. The assay is proposed as a potential therapy for SMA.

6,pcba,ckpts/gimlet_fp3modalnew/checkpoint-10000,0,0,0.6265800881543577,"The assay used a recombinant fragment of the protein tau, called K18, with a specific mutation, to identify inhibitors of tau aggregation. The assay monitored fibrillization using Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. Tau is important for stabilizing microtubules in neurons and contributes to important cellular functions, but can lead to neuronal loss and dysfunction when aggregated into neurofibrillary tangles.
