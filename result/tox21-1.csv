Catalyzes three successive oxidations of C19 androgens: two conventional oxidations at C19 yielding 19-hydroxy and 19-oxo/19-aldehyde derivatives, followed by a third oxidative aromatization step that involves C1-beta hydrogen abstraction combined with cleavage of the C10-C19 bond to yield a phenolic A ring and formic acid (PMID: 20385561). Alternatively, the third oxidative reaction yields a 19-norsteroid and formic acid. Is this molecule toxic to Aromatase?",train
